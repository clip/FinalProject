                <p> I chose this topic because there hasn't been a lot of detailed analysis done on it. So, my goal is to dig deep and uncover new insights that will help us understand the data better. I believe that my research could make a real difference in how we think about this topic. By carefully analyzing and interpreting the data, I hope to provide valuable information for policymakers and others who are trying to address the issue.</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-300">A: High crime rates in areas where school shootings occur don't seem to have a big influence on the number of school shooters. Other factors likely play a bigger role in why school shootings happen more often in certain places.</p>

                    <h3 class="text-lg font-medium mb-2">Q: are officers taking too long to arrive?</h3>
                    <p class="text-gray-300">A: Emergency response times for officers can vary greatly depending on state, location, and region. Some departments take only 5-7 minutes, while others take 15-20 minutes due to factors like traffic and distance. Rural areas typically have longer response times due to fewer officers and greater distances to schools compared to urban areas.</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-300">A: Factors such as traffic, distance, and emergency resource availability can impact response times for school shootings. Although hospitals and police departments may be close to the school, it doesn't always mean they're easily accessible in an emergency.</p>

                    <h3 class="text-lg font-medium mb-2">Q: What went wrong? Why were there so many deaths? </h3>
                    <p class="text-gray-300">A: Sandy Hook Elementary School is one of the deadliest shootings in America. There were 26 deaths because there were no resource officers nearby, and also the fact that many died because the closest hospital is 17 minutes away. Resource officers are funded by the government or the town. There are usually almost no officers watching schools in smaller areas. They're more vurnable to being attacked or targetted compared to urban areas especially, since this attack was indiscriminate.</p>
